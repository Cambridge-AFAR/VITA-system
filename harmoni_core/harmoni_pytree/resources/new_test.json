To have that same experience of thinking through things you're grateful for. <break time ='3s'/> So next time, our exercise will focus on accomplishments. Before you go, please take a moment to fill in the questionnaire's on the tablet. Once you're done, just let RESEARCHERNAME know, they'll ask you a few questions before you go.
